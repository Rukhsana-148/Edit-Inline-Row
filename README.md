# Edit Inline Row

## Aim of the Project
 I have developed this project "Edit Inline Row" so that you can edit your information without going another page.
 
## Background
In our modern time "ToDo" is very essentail and daily necessary website or app. Our life is changeable and there can be some mistake thats why we need to edit or delete our information in the todo list.It is very interesting and useful for the user if he can edit and delete his todo list from the list by clicking on the data. He do not need to another form page to edit.


## Expected Output
1. Everyone can fill up their form and see the information in the same page.
2. All information is the input field but it will be showed as a data without input field. 
3. When you want to delete , you click delete option and data will be deleted and deleted data will not be present in the todo list.
4. When you want to need to  edit your information , you click on your data and edit. At last you can click on "Ok" button. Then edited information is showed in your todo list.
